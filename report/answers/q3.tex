\section{Question 3}

This problem can be represented as a \textit{minimum-weighted dominating set problem (MDSP)}.  \\

To convert our problem into a \textit{MDSP} we precompute the shortest distance between each pair of nodes in the graph, which can be easily done using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph.
Then we construct the reachability matrix by checking the distance between each pair of nodes.

\begin{align*}
	M \in \mathcal{M}_{n \times n} (\{0, 1\})  \\
	M_{ij} = \begin{cases}
		1 & \text{if } d_{ij} \leq T \\
		0 & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
\end{align*}

We can solve the \textit{MDSP} using the reachability matrix as the graph's adjacency matrix to obtain the solution to the original problem.
