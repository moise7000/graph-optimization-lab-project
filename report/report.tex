    \subsection*{Question 5}
    \textit{How can the cutset inequalities for network design be applied to the problem described in 4? Generate all the single node cutset-based inequalities (those that consider the cuts separating each single node from the others). Add them to the formulation and compute the continuous relaxation with and without them. Compare the two relaxations solving the instances. Are the inequalities effective? Upload the \texttt{.run} and \texttt{.mod} files, and a \texttt{.pdf} file with the updated model and the comparison of the two continuous relaxations.}

    \section*{Question 6}
    \textit{How can the cover inequalities for the knapsack problem be applied to the problem described in 4? Generate heuristically some cover-based inequalities, add them to the formulation and compute the continuous relaxation with and without them for all the instances. Are they effective? Upload the \texttt{.run} and \texttt{.mod} files, and a \texttt{.pdf} with the results and the updated model.}
